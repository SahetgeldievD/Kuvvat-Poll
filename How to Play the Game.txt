	General Setup

	When using this application do not hold down on keys on the keyboard or things will go wacky fast! Single quick firm key presses should be sufficient.
	
	There is one file whose contents you can carefully make changes to in the scripts folder called Variables.js. The top most section contains initialization variables such as which life lines have already been used, a static contestants name and location and what question level to start on. BE CAREFUL when editing these values or the application may not work.
	
	To turn off a life line that has already been used change its value to "true" instead of "false". If switch the question is used, you will set its value to "false" for both "IsSTQLifelineUsed" and "IsSTQAvailableFromTheStart".
	
	There are two ways to obtain questions for this game. 
	
		1) Just like the Flash game version you will have 2 static XML files located in the Questions folder, one for regular questions and one for switching the questions out with the "switch the question" lifeline.
		
		2) This is one of the areas that having web development experience comes in handy. The method named "getAllQuestionsForGame" located inside the Init.js file under the scripts folder by default pulls questions from a static location. There is a commented out section of code that is pre-defined if you know how to make server side calls to a database or some other data source to obtain questions. Once you obtain the questions, you then map them to a new "QuestionAndAnswer()" object correctly. This method makes two calls, one for regular questions and one for switch questions and places them into the correct data arrays.

	Key Mappings / How To Use
	
	The fastest way to learn how to operate the controller is to play around with it. DO NOT PRESS THE KEYS TO FAST CONSECUTIVELY OR YOU MAY GET THE ANIMATIONS OUT OF ORDER. The following keys are mapped as follows:
	
	A - This key is used for all things that involve "Ask The Audience" from animating the voting sequence to pulsing the lifeline on the money tree.
		* When a question is active and all answers are revealed, press the key repeatedly for each animation until the voting graph leaves the screen.
		** If the money tree is showing and the lifeline hasn't been used yet, press once to pulse the lifeline on the money tree.
	
	C - This key is used for going into and out of a commercial break. The key also "hides/shows" the Millionaire logo.
		* When there are no graphics being displayed on the screen press this key to go into and come out of a commercial break. The logo will fill the screen when a break is in progress. Also after the intial load of the app this button plays a game intro sound only once until you end the game for
		  the day using the "G" key.
	
	E - This key plays the explain rules sound. The explain rules sound loops about 4 times before stopping.

		** If the money tree is showing and the lifeline hasn't been used yet, press once to pulse the lifeline on the money tree.
		
	G - This key is used to play the time up sound followed by the closing theme. It also resets certain animations back to a beginning default as if the game was resumed later.

		** If the money tree is showing and the lifeline hasn't been used yet, press once to pulse the lifeline on the money tree.
	
	Q - This key is used for playing the question resume sound after returning from a commercial break.
		* When no graphics (not counting the money tree) are showing press this key to play the question resume sound.

		** If the money tree is showing and the lifeline hasn't been used yet and is available, press once to pulse the lifeline on the money tree.
		*** If the money is showing and the lifeline has not been unlocked yet press this key three times. The first press sets the diamonds, the second press slides it into view and the third press pulses it.
	
	U - This key is used to undo a final answer and to play a new instance of the current background cue during a question if the previous sound stops. If the sound stops press the key to start a new instance or simply replace the cue with a longer version if you have one.
		* After final answer has been locked in you may press this key to undo the final answer (though technically it was finaled :])
		** If all answers have been revealed and the background music stopped playing while thinking about the question use this same key to restart that sound. This can be overcome by replacing the cues with longer versions of you own.
	
	W - This key is used to animate the walk away sequence.
		* When all answers are revealed press this key to begin the walk away sequence. After the first press you may press 1, 2, 3 or 4 to lock in a "guess" at what the answer would have been. Each press thereafter reveals the answer animations accordingly. DO NOT USE THE RIGHT ARROW KEY TO FINISH THIS SEQUENCE OR THE ANIMATIONS WILL BREAK.

	Right Arrow Key - This key is used for all animations from the point where a question is revealed to where either the contestant loses or wins the round.
